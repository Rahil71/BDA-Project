Content-Based Filtering is a recommendation technique that suggests items (such as news articles, products, or movies) based on the characteristics or attributes of the items and the user's previous preferences or interactions. In content-based filtering, the system analyzes the content of items (such as text, metadata, tags, or keywords) and compares it to the userâ€™s profile to make personalized recommendations. In the digital age, the overwhelming volume of available news articles poses a significant challenge for users seeking relevant and personalized content. This project presents a content-based news recommendation system that leverages user preferences and article characteristics to provide tailored news suggestions .The system utilizes Natural Language Processing NLP techniques like stemming, tokenization, and stopword removal to preprocess news articles. The core of the recommendation mechanism relies on a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer and cosine similarity. These enable the system to capture the content of news articles and recommend similar articles to users based on the textual features of the news they have selected. The application is built with an interactive user interface using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly experience where users can select a news article and receive recommendations of similar articles. This system aims to improve user engagement by delivering relevant news content tailored to their interests.
